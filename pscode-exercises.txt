// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

A + B = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

(1.Begin.
 2.Write “Please enter two numbers to add”.
 3.Read num1.
 4.Read num2.
 5.Sum = num1+num2.
 6.Print Sum.


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(1.Start
 2.Display "32"
 3.Read #
 4.If number is MOD 2 = 0 Then
  Display "Even"
  Else
 Display "Odd"
End if
5. Stop)
 
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(
1.Start
 2.Input #1,#2,#3,#4,#5
 3.avg equal (#1+#2+#3+#4+#5)/5
  Small equal #1
  Large equal #1
  If #1 > #i then:
  small = #i
  if n#1 < #i then:
  large = #i
 4.print("Average:", avg)
 5.print("Smallest:", small)
 6.print("Largest:", large)
 )
